This code book documents the tidy data set produced for the
project in the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data 
offered by Jeff Leek, Roger D. Peng, and Brian Caffo offered
Johns Hopkins University.

This codebook created by David Herold.
The data set produced in file myTidyMotionData.txt
written from R by the function:
write.table(motiondf, file="myTidyMotionData.txt", row.names=FALSE)
